Scrape Glassdoor website for data analyst positions, create database in mysql and create summary dashboards on Tableau

In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for analytics professionals in the job market. Schools are launching new programs to fill in the gap between the supply and demand. In addition to delivering a well-crafted curriculum setting, schools have also been exploiting a great career-development service for students.
In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the job market in the area, we were reached out by UC Davis MSBA program, a newborn program in San Francisco, to help gather resources to lay a solid foundation of the career-service database. With the goal in mind, we decided to build a SQL database with job and company information in San Francisco/Bay Area. Information is all collected from Glassdoor, an online job-listing platform. Secondly, we generated a Tableau dashboard with summary statistics, which would be refreshed with the data tables once every week. Furthermore, we created an analyst-specific job search filter, which is grouped by job titles and displays company names with estimated salaries.
